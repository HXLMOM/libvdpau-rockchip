This is an experimental VDPAU implementation for ODROID SoCs.

Most features of full VDPAU are missing, only decoding of h264, mpeg1 and
mpeg2 and output of software-decoded videos will work.

Only tested with mplayer, if other players need unimplemented functions
something will fail.

   $ make
   $ make install

   $ export VDPAU_DRIVER=odroid

and then for mplayer:
   $ mplayer -vo vdpau -vc ffmpeg12vdpau,ffh264vdpau, [filename]
or for mpv:
   $ mpv --vo=vdpau --hwdec=vdpau --hwdec-codecs=all [filename]
